    description: 'Half of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture. For much of human history, most of the world’s land was wilderness: forests, grasslands and shrubbery dominated its landscapes. Over the last few centuries, this has changed dramatically: wild habitats have been squeezed out by turning it into agricultural land. If we rewind 1000 years, it is estimated that only 4 million square kilometers – less than 4% of the world’s ice-free and non-barren land area was used for farming. 10% of the world is covered by glaciers, and a further 19% is barren land – deserts, dry salt flats, beaches, sand dunes, and exposed rocks. This leaves what we call ‘habitable land’. Half of all habitable land is used for agriculture.'

    description: 'Water withdrawals, are defined as freshwater taken from ground or surface water sources, either permanently or temporarily, and conveyed to a place of use. 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are used for agriculture. A growing global population and economic shift towards more resource-intensive consumption patterns means global freshwater use — that is, freshwater withdrawals for agriculture, industry and municipal uses — has increased nearly six-fold since 1900. Rates of global freshwater use increased sharply from the 1950s onwards, but since 2000 appears to be plateauing, or at least slowing'

    description: 'Water is a precious resource in our planet. Its relative availability—71% of the Earth’s surface is water—has been responsible for a lack of further efforts towards water consumption efficiency. The total amount of water is 1.38×1018 m3. Only 2.6% is freshwater, and out of that, 10% alone is accessible, around 3.7×1015 m3. Water scarcity occurs when water demand exceeds internal water resources. Recently, numerous reports have estimated that by 2025 two-thirds of the population will suffer water scarcity. '

The runoff of nitrogen and other nutrients from agricultural production systems is a leading contributor. 78% of global ocean and freshwater eutrophication (the pollution of waterways with nutrient-rich pollutants) is caused by agriculture.'
